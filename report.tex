\begin {abstract}
This report details recent advances in the optimisation of computing resources
for quantum approaches to solving the vehicle routing problem (VRP) and 
its variants. This set of problems is of significant importance with regard
to logistical applications in industry. In accordance with the input
constraints of the quantum hardware, the problem is formulated as a quadratic
unconstrained binary optimisation (QUBO). A simple approach known as the
full encoding results in each solution represented by a unique basis state,
thereby requiring one qubit per classical variable. Due to this inefficiency
in resource allocation when considering the at worst factorial search space,
a more optimised minimal encoding is suggested that offers a logarithmic
reduction in necessary computing power. In spite of certain drawbacks incurred
by employing this minimal encoding, experiments have shown that the solution
quality is not heavily impacted.
