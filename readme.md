Research report compiled as part of a
[Seminar: Advanced Topics of Quantum Computing (IN2107, IN2183, IN0014)](https://www.moodle.tum.de/course/view.php?id=90622)
held by the [Chair for Quantum Computing](https://www5.in.tum.de/~quanTUMcomputing/) at
[Technische Universität München](https://www.cit.tum.de/cit/startseite/).

The report summarises recent research in optimising the problem encoding of [NP hard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness)
[combinatorial optimisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_optimization) problems for computational resource
efficiency on [NISQ era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noisy_intermediate-scale_quantum_era) devices running the
[QAOA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_optimization_algorithms), focusing in particular on the application to the
[Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_routing_problem) and its variants.
